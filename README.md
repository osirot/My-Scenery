# My-Scenery
draws a simple GUI scene using Java 

This scenery is made up of house and tree images built using Java. This assignment was created for a cs142 
class where the instructor built a few base files and I had to take the file, and build onto it to create my scene. 
This assignment was helping me build skills in java, JFrame, GUI, and my ability to read other programmers code and build 
onto it. 

To run the GUI download all Java files, MyScene.java is the file to run the program if you run it in a java ide. 
When it runs you should see trees with colorful houses, a message box pops up and when you click the scenery changes.
